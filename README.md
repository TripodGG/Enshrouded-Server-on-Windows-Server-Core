# Enshrouded Server on Windows Server Core
A Powershell script to install everything needed to create and set up a dedicated Enshrouded server on Windows Server Core.

While running a dedicated game server is best ran on a Linux server, not all games offer this.  This script was written to solve the problem of running a dedicated game server on Windows.  The reason we all love Linux game servers is because they're headless.  Command line only.  Windows generally does not install this way.  However, there is a headless Windows option; Windows Server Core.

Running a Windows Server Core OS can be difficult if you're not real great with Powershell.  So, this script fixes all that.  It will install everything you need, including Nano for Windows to modify your config file, to install and host your very own Enshrouded Dedicated Server.

Enjoy!
